## _Summary_
John Lomax and his wife traveled around the southern United States collecting folk songs in the late 19th century to preserve for future scholar analysis. The website is divided 
by the eight states and/or areas where the Lomaxes ventured in which each folk song from that particular area is highlighted and can be listened to. The goal for this website is 
to present all folk songs that were discovered and documented throughout the Lomaxes’ travels.
## _Design_
At first glance, the website reels the reader in with its organization and appropriate choice in color contrast. With a dark background throughout the website, the bolded hot pink 
headings as well as the white letters and paragraphs are easy to focus on. The highlighted small paragraphs encourage consistent engagement on the words presented. In between the 
colored paragraphs, the readers get a break from formal information with direct quotes from the field notes. This allows them to better visualize realities of the Lomaxes’ trip.
