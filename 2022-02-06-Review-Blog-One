## _Summary_
John Lomax and his wife traveled around the southern United States collecting folk songs in the late 19th century to preserve for future scholar analysis. The website is divided by the eight states and/or areas where the Lomaxes ventured in which each folk song from that particular area is highlighted and can be listened to. The goal for this website is to present all folk songs that were discovered and documented throughout the Lomaxesâ€™ travels.
