## _Summary_
John Lomax and his wife traveled around the southern United States collecting folk songs in the late 19th century to preserve for future scholar analysis. The website is divided 
by the eight states and/or areas where the Lomaxes ventured in which each folk song from that particular area is highlighted and can be listened to. The goal for this website is 
to present all folk songs that were discovered and documented throughout the Lomaxes’ travels.
## _Design_
At first glance, Southern Mosaic reels the reader in with its organization and appropriate choice in color contrast. With a dark background throughout the website, the bolded hot pink headings as well as the white letters and paragraphs are easy to focus on. The highlighted small paragraphs encourage consistent engagement on the words presented. In between the colored paragraphs, the readers get a break from formal information with direct quotes from the field notes. The quotes give better visuals of the Lomaxes’ trip while allowing them to get to know their character. 

Scrolling down the website, the adventures of each state are divided into sections within the same page. The songs are highlighted in each paragraph and will play music when clicked on. Each section ends with genre breakdowns where each song is listed in small various colored dots depending where it is categorized. Not only are the songs displayed on a simple chart, they are also organized on a moving contraption of connected lines and dots. These unique organizations are a creative way to learn more about the songs.
## _Critiques_
The beginning of the website features a map that shows the journey through the eight states. As it travels, it describes notable locations where the Lomaxes stopped. Some locations were not given enough time to read and comprehend before moving on to the next description. Unfortunately the map does not allow the reader to pause or go back to a specific location. If the map enables readers to click on the map when they are ready rather than moving on its own, each message would have a better impact.

Although the color contrast was engaging, having all the information on one page is overwhelming. The information is interesting and well organized, however, it becomes tiresome and overbearing to continue to scroll and read. Dividing the sections into different pages would be better for maintaining reader interest. This would be more efficient rather than having one whole page of scrolling.
